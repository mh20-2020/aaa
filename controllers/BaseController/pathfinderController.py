class PathFinderController:

    Constructs an instantiate of the PathFinderController for navigating a
    3-DOF wheeled robot on a 2D plane

    Parameters
    ----------
    Kp_rho : The linear velocity gain to translate the robot along a line
             towards the goal
    Kp_alpha : The angular velocity gain to rotate the robot towards the goal
    Kp_beta : The offset angular velocity gain accounting for smooth merging to
              the goal angle (i.e., it helps the robot heading to be parallel
              to the target angle.)
